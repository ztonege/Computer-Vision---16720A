Check float 
normalize between 0 and 1 - Done
change from add new axis to np.stack in q1.1
supposed to change fitler scales array? - Done
change default output location - Done
calculate L - Done
value 60 in compute_one_dict_image needs to be generalized - Done
Tiles are not always square...- Done
change the var tiles
dynamic way to convert (210,) to (210,1) 
weights not working - currently hard coded, fixed by casting L to int inside of SPM function - Done
changed loop from L+1 to L, TEST THIS!
What about if L = 0??
get rid of print statements
Why do we use multiple scales 


pass through filtering
tube is word
take alpha of tubes 
plot it into n space 

one image - takes alpha many tubes and saves it to a file 

25 tubes for each photo and each tube is 3f in degree 
k number of dict words - 10

compute_one_dictionary - 25 tubes passed to a file which can be read to 

however many images - create that many csv files (or numpy) 
25 3F long tubes
